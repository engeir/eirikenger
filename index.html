            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>I am currently doing a PhD at <a href="https://en.uit.no/startsida">UiT The
                Arctic University of Troms√∏</a>. The working title of the project is
            <q>Global temperature response to volcanic activity</q>, where we will be
            looking at how the global mean temperature responds to volcanic activity using
            a new non-parametric approach.</p>
            <p>You can have a look at my <strong>CV</strong> <a
                href="https://resume.eirikenger.xyz">here</a>, or <a
                href="https://resume.eirikenger.xyz/index.pdf">download it as PDF</a>.</p>
            <p>I have another website over at
            <a href="https://flottflyt.com">flottflyt.com</a>.
            There I put up things I find interesting and projects I work on in my spare
            time.</p>

            <h2>Master Thesis</h2>
            <p> My master thesis was titled <a
                href="https://hdl.handle.net/10037/19542"><strong><q>A model for IS
                        spectra for magnetized plasma with arbitrary isotropic velocity
                        distributions</q></strong></a>. It discusses radar theory related
            to incoherent scatter radars and measurement of suprathermal electrons,
            electrons with more energy than the normal population of electrons present in
            the upper atmosphere. A large part of the thesis work was put into creating a
            code that solved the power spectrum of said suprathermal electrons
            numerically. The home page of the source code is available <a
                href="https://engeir.github.io/isr-spectrum/">here</a>.</p>
